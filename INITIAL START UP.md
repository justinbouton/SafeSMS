When an earthquake of desired "X" magnitude occurs it triggers an automated SMS to the list of users. The Users reply status light changes from red to green upon SMS receipt of "Yes or Y" from the user signifying they are safe. Users can reply directly to the SMS with a breif message. Messaging is available to the admin via SMS or the Users page by clicking on the individual. The admin is notified via SMS of all triggered events and all SMS responses.
